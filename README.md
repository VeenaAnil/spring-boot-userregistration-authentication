Response : Will provide the gewnerated token in the response header.

Please write a Spring REST controller that handles user registration. The REST resource should be accessible via "/userservice/register" and
accepts following JSON data:
{
"firstName": "Some first name",
"lastName": "The last name",
"userName": "The user name",
"password": "The password in plain text"
}
In case of success it should return the user object without the password:
{
"id": "Id generated by the back-end",
"firstName": "Some first name",
"lastName": "The last name",
"userName": "The user name"
}
In case the username is already existing, an error response should be returned with HTTP error-code 409:
{
"code": "USER_ALREADY_EXISTS",
"description": "A user with the given username already exists"
}
